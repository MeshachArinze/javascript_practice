/*
Let’s return to functions and study them more in-depth.

Our first topic will be recursion.

If you are not new to programming, then it is probably familiar and you could skip this chapter.

Recursion is a programming pattern that is useful in situations when a task can be naturally split into several tasks of the same kind, but simpler. Or when a task can be simplified into an easy action plus a simpler variant of the same task. Or, as we’ll see soon, to deal with certain data structures.

When a function solves a task, in the process it can call many other functions. A partial case of this is when a function calls itself. That’s called recursion.

         result *= x;
    }

    return result;

console.log(pow(2, 3));
