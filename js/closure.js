/*
What’s much more interesting, a nested function can be returned: either as a property of a new object or as a result by itself. It can then be used somewhere else. No matter where, it still has access to the same outer variables.

Below, makeCounter creates the “counter” function that returns the next number on each invocation:
*/

function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0;

  return function() {
    return count++;
  };
}

let counter = makeCounter();

console.log( counter() ); // 0
console.log( counter() ); // 1
console.log( counter() ); // 2
